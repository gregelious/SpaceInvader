Summary: 
I will be making a replica of the classic game Space Invaders in Processing. There will be one player at the bottom of the screen that can move and shoot once the relevant keys are pressed, there will be enemies that are on the upper portion of the screen that move and shoot on their own. The players and enemies will be able to damage each other when theyâ€™re bullet lands. There will also be barriers between the enemies and the player that take damage so the player can take shelter under it, but eventually they will be broken after taking too much damage.

Compile: Open any one of the .pde files in processing

Run: Press the triangle on the top left

Play the Game: 

Press A or LEFT ARROW to move left

Press D or RIGHT ARROW to move right

Click mouse button to shoot

For presentation purposes, it starts at level 4, to start at beginning, go to the setup and change "level = 4" to "level = 0"
